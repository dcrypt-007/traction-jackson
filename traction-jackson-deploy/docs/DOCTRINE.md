# DOCTRINE: Traction Jackson — Video Automation v1

## Purpose

Traction Jackson exists to convert MVP hypotheses into validated learning with maximum speed and minimum founder labor.

The product is not "marketing software." It is a **closed-loop experimentation system** that generates, deploys, measures, and iterates on demand tests.

---

## Prime Directive

> The founder must never do repetitive multi-app labor.
> The founder's role is **judgment and direction**.
> The system's role is **coordination and execution**.

---

## Operator Model

### Founder Responsibilities

1. Define intent (hypotheses, budgets, tone)
2. Approve/reject creatives
3. Interpret results
4. Decide next experiment / scale

### System Responsibilities

1. Generate creatives
2. Assemble videos
3. Deploy campaigns
4. Collect funnel signals
5. Enforce guardrails
6. Summarize learnings in plain English

---

## V1 Scope (Hard Constraints)

- **Video ads only**
- **Platforms:** Meta/Instagram and TikTok
- **One product active at a time**
- **One CTA per experiment**
- **Human approval required** before anything goes live
- **No auto-scaling**
- **Depth > breadth**

---

## Canonical Unit of Work: Creative Batch

All production work is organized into a **Creative Batch**:

- One hypothesis
- One audience context
- One CTA
- Multiple video variants

A Creative Batch is the **only object the founder approves**.

The system must prevent unapproved creatives from being deployed.

---

## Automation Philosophy

> **Automate the factory, not the taste.**

### 100% Automate:
- Hooks, scripts, voiceovers
- Template population, exports
- Uploads, naming, UTMs

### Human-in-Loop:
- Creative approval
- Hypothesis selection
- Scaling decisions

---

## Determinism Over Chaos (V1)

To avoid noisy learning:

- Use a **fixed video structure** and timing rules
- Use a **small set of canonical templates**
- Use **1–2 house voices**
- Prefer **consistency** for early signal

---

## Guardrails (Transparent, Conservative)

The system may pause or flag creatives using simple, auditable rules:

- CTR thresholds after minimum impressions
- Spend limits before human review

**The system must not increase budgets or scale without explicit founder action.**

---

## Measurement Ladder (Signal > Vanity)

**Primary success:** Qualified conversion (email + phone)

**Secondary signals** are the funnel steps that explain *why*:

| Step | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Page view → AI interaction started |
| 2 | AI interaction → Revenue calc completed |
| 3 | Revenue calc → Contact info submitted |

The system should diagnose drop-offs and report **"what we learned"** clearly.

---

## One-Time Setup Is Acceptable

One-time setup steps are allowed and should be guided with checklists:

- Canva templates + API access + template IDs
- 11Labs voices + API key
- Meta/TikTok account connections + permissions
- Pixel/event tracking validation

**After setup, the founder should not need to open external tools for daily operation.**

---

## Default Bias

> **Speed of validated learning > creative perfection.**

If the system can launch a clean experiment in hours and learn in days, it is working.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a "marketing platform"
- Not an AI that makes all decisions
- Not a scaling engine (V1)
- Not a multi-channel Swiss army knife

---

## Success Criteria

Traction Jackson is successful when:

1. A founder can launch a video ad experiment **without opening any external tools**
2. Creative generation + deployment happens in **minutes**
3. Founder time is spent **only on judgment and decisions**
4. Learning velocity increases **materially**
