You are writing a short-form video ad script (5-15 seconds) for an MVP traction test.

**Context:**
- Product: [PRODUCT_NAME]
- Hook to use: "[THE OPENING HOOK]"
- Landing page CTA: [e.g., "See how much you're losing"]
- What the landing page does: [e.g., "AI calculates their lost revenue and shows potential recovery"]

**Script Structure:**
1. HOOK (0-3 sec): The attention-grabber [already provided]
2. BRIDGE (3-8 sec): Quick context that builds intrigue
3. CTA (8-12 sec): Drive to landing page

**Rules:**
- Total script: 30-50 words max
- Don't explain the product—create curiosity
- Don't make promises the landing page can't deliver
- Sound like a person, not a brand
- The landing page AI does the selling

**Output Format:**

HOOK: [Opening line]
BRIDGE: [1-2 sentences building intrigue]
CTA: [Call to action]

---

TEXT ON SCREEN:
[Frame 1]: [Text]
[Frame 2]: [Text]
[Frame 3]: [Text]

---

CREATIVE NOTES:

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

**Hook Used:** "Your appointment book has holes in it. I can see them from here."

---

**HOOK:** Your appointment book has holes in it. I can see them from here.

**BRIDGE:** Here's the thing—every empty slot is money walking out the door. And you're not getting it back by hoping people reschedule.

**CTA:** There's an AI that fills those gaps automatically. Link in bio to see what you're actually losing.

---

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**
[Frame 1]: Your appointment book
[Frame 2]: has holes in it
[Frame 3]: Let AI fill them → link in bio

---

**CREATIVE NOTES:**
- POV: Direct to camera, founder/insider vibe
- Tone: Confident, slightly provocative, not salesy
- Pacing: Medium—let the hook land, don't rush
- Visual: Talking head or screen recording of calendar with empty slots

## SCRIPT VARIATIONS BY HOOK FAMILY

### Pain Scripts
- Focus on the problem
- Make it feel urgent but not panicky
- End with "there's a way to fix this"

### Automation Scripts
- Focus on the contrast (manual vs automatic)
- Use "while you [X], the AI is [Y]" structure
- End with "see how it works"

### Loss Aversion Scripts
- Lead with a specific number
- Make it personal ("your number")
- End with "find out what you're losing"

### Curiosity Scripts
- Tease information they don't know
- Use "the real reason" or "what I found out" framing
- End with "link shows you exactly what I mean"
